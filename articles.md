This page lists the very best Python engineering articles of the internet, hand-picked to give hours and hours 
of pure reading joy.
It is especially designed for onboarding new members on your Python team. Great for skilling up.
Though not necessarily read one after the other, the order is nevertheless not random. 
For example, knowledge of CPython internals specially bytecodes are necessary to make sense of B. Cannon's 
unravelling series. 
The articles are focused on core Python and it's as advanced as articles can get.
